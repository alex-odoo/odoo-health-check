## [17.0.1.0.0] - 2026-04-30

Initial public release for Odoo 17. Feature parity with the v18 listing
release `18.0.1.12.3` plus the changes required for Odoo 17's ORM:

* `_callback(self, cron_name, server_action_id, job_id)` override
  matches the Odoo 17 base signature (v18 dropped the `job_id`
  parameter mid-major; v17 keeps it). The override picks up the cron
  id from `job_id` since `self` is the empty model when called from
  `_process_job`.
* Test fixtures updated to pass the third `job_id` arg to
  `cron._callback(...)`.
* Reset module version to 17.0.1.0.0 (first publication on the v17
  apps.odoo.com listing per Constitution §6).
* Listing description, README, and badge updated to mention Odoo 17.
* README/listing GitHub URLs corrected from the legacy alex-odoo
  org to RteamAgency (the repo lived at alex-odoo before the org
  transfer).
* CHANGELOG reset to a single 17.0.1.0.0 "Initial public release"
  entry (no prior live installs on v17 listing, no upgrade history
  to preserve).

Features brought forward from the v18 listing:

* At-a-glance dashboard (cron failures 24h/7d, disk root and filestore
  current usage, latest PG monthly report)
* Cron execution history with duration and error traceback, written
  through an independent cursor so cron rollbacks do not erase audit
  rows. Email alert on every failure.
* Hourly disk monitoring on OS root and the Odoo filestore mount,
  worsening-transition alert emails (no per-tick spam).
* Monthly PostgreSQL growth report (1st of each month at 08:00) with
  top-10 tables, byte/row deltas, total DB size delta vs prior report.
* Localised UI and emails in 8 languages: English, Russian, Ukrainian,
  German, Spanish, Romanian, Polish, Arabic.
