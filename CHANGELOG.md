## [19.0.1.0.0] - 2026-04-30

Initial public release for Odoo 19. Feature parity with the v18 listing
release `18.0.1.12.3` plus the changes required for Odoo 19's ORM:

* `_sql_constraints` (deprecated in 19, logs a WARNING) replaced with
  the new `models.Constraint` API. Same `CHECK (date_end IS NULL OR
  date_end >= date_start)` invariant on `ir.cron.history.date_order`.
* Manifest, README, and listing description updated for Odoo 19.

Features brought forward from the v18 listing:

* At-a-glance dashboard (cron failures 24h/7d, disk root and filestore
  current usage, latest PG monthly report)
* Cron execution history with duration and error traceback, written
  through an independent cursor so cron rollbacks do not erase audit
  rows. Email alert on every failure.
* Hourly disk monitoring on OS root and the Odoo filestore mount,
  worsening-transition alert emails (no per-tick spam).
* Monthly PostgreSQL growth report (1st of each month at 08:00) with
  top-10 tables, byte/row deltas, total DB size delta vs prior report.
* Localised UI and emails in 8 languages: English, Russian, Ukrainian,
  German, Spanish, Romanian, Polish, Arabic.
